            یادگاری اسپتالِ شوکت خانم برائے معالجہ و تحقیقِ سرطان, abbreviated as SKMCH&RC/SKMCH)</span> [1] is a cancer
          centre with locations in Lahore and Peshawar, Pakistan. It is the first project of the Shaukat Khanum Memorial
          Trust, a charitable organization established under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1858 of British
          India. It is Pakistan's largest tertiary care hospital
        </p>
        <p>The hospital was founded by Imran Khan, Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician and former Prime Minister. The
          inspiration to build a cancer hospital came after his mother, Mrs. Shaukat Khanum, succumbed to cancer in
          1985. During his mother's illness, he also witnessed the plight of poor cancer patients in Pakistan's
          hospitals, and deeply felt the need for a specialized cancer centre in his country. He had a vision of making
          cancer treatment accessible to every Pakistani who needed it. This is reflected in the hospital's mission
          statement:</p>

        <h5 class="fw-bolder ">Entry into politics:</h5>
        <p>After his retirement from cricket, Khan became an outspoken critic of government mismanagement and corruption
          in Pakistan. <span style="background-color: rgb(16, 124, 16);"> He founded his own political party, Pakistan
            Tehreek-e-Insaf (Pakistan Justice Movement; PTI), in 1996.</span> In national elections held the following
          year, the newly formed party won less than 1 percent of the vote and failed to win any seats in the National
          Assembly, but it fared slightly better in the 2002 elections, winning a single seat that Khan filled. Khan
          maintained that vote rigging was to blame for his party’s low vote totals. In October 2007 Khan was among a
          group of politicians who resigned from the National Assembly, protesting Pres. Pervez Musharraf’s candidacy in
          the upcoming presidential election. In November Khan was briefly imprisoned during a crackdown against critics
          of Musharraf, who had declared a state of emergency. The PTI condemned the state of emergency, which ended in
          mid-December, and boycotted the 2008 national elections to protest Musharraf’s rule.</p>
        <p>
          In spite of the PTI’s struggles in elections, Khan’s populist positions found support, especially among young
          people. He continued his criticism of corruption and economic inequality in Pakistan and opposed the Pakistani
          government’s cooperation with the United States in fighting militants near the Afghan border. He also launched
          broadsides against Pakistan’s political and economic elites, whom he accused of being Westernized and out of
          touch with Pakistan’s religious and cultural norms.</p>

          Imran Khan injured in fall while campaigning
          Close
          Imran Khan, one of Pakistan's most prominent politicians, is recovering in hospital after being injured
          falling from an elevated platform at an election rally in Lahore.

          The former cricketer, who has been urging Pakistanis to vote in Saturday's parliamentary elections, suffered a
          head injury but is not thought to have been seriously hurt.</p>
        <p id="show" style="cursor: pointer; color: red;">see more</p>
        <p id="one">Television pictures showed Khan, 60, the leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI), who was
          campaigning in Lahore ahead of Saturday's election, being pulled off an overcrowded platform and falling
          around four metres to the ground after one of his guards lost balance and toppled over the side.

          Khan had squeezed on to the small lift carrying him and five other members of his staff up to a stage, when
          another man tried to clamber aboard.

          Although Khan, who has only won one seat in past elections, is not expected to win, he has been gaining
          momentum in recent days.

          A frantic schedule of back-to-back campaign events has helped to galvanise a young, middle-class fan base with
          huge numbers of supporters flocking to his events.

          The PTI reassured supporters that Khan had not suffered serious injuries. "Imran Khan is up, he is talking to
          people around him, and he recognised everyone," a statement said. "However, he is still undergoing tests so
          please pray for him."</p>

              Imran Khan reaches out to young voters with 'third-way' in Pakistan's general election</h5>
            <p class="card-text">On the morning of May 11, 2013, millions of people who before PTI had never cared about
              politics lined up outside their polling station to vote. When results were announced there was delirium
              and disappointment in the PTI camp.
            </p>
            <p> But at least there was KPK. The PTI now had a base. By winning seats across the country, the PTI had
              established itself as a national party of Pakistan, its main rivals PML-N seen as a party of the Punjab
              and PPP restricted only to rural and interior Sindh. A third force had arrived and PTI had what many
              decades old parties did not have: a chief minister.</p>

        <h1 id="pakistan">Pakistan general elections 2018: Analysis of results and implications</h1>
        <p>General elections were held in Pakistan on 25 July 2018 to elect the members of 15th National Assembly and
          the four Provincial Assemblies. The three major parties were Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) led by Imran Khan,
          the Pakistan Muslim League led by Shehbaz Sharif and the Pakistan Peoples Party led by Bilawal Bhutto. The PTI
          won the most seats in the National Assembly but fell short of a majority; the party subsequently formed a
          coalition government with several smaller parties. At the provincial level, the PTI remained the largest party
          in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP); the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) retained its dominance in Sindh and the newly
          formed Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) emerged as the largest party in Balochistan. In Punjab, the result was a
          hung parliament with the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML(N)) winning the most seats. However, after several
          independents MPAs joined the PTI, the latter became the largest party and was able to form a government.
        </p>
        <p>
          Opinion polling prior to the campaigns starting had initially shown leads for the Pakistan Muslim League (N)
          (PML(N)) over the PTI. However, from an 11-point lead, the PML(N)'s lead began to diminish in the final weeks
          of the campaign, with some polls close to the election showing the PTI with a marginal but increasing lead. In
          the lead-up to the elections, there were rumours about some pre-poll rigging being conducted by the judiciary,
          the military and the intelligence agencies to sway the election results in favour of the PTI and against the
          PML(N).[2][3] However, Reuters polling suggested PML(N)'s lead had genuinely narrowed in the run-up to the
          elections, and that the party had suffered "blow after blow" which caused setbacks to any hopes of
          re-election.[4]
        </p>
        <p>
          Election day saw the PTI receive 32% of the vote (its highest share of the vote since its foundation), while
          the PML(N) received 24%. Following the elections, six major parties including PML(N) claimed there had been
          large-scale vote rigging and administrative malpractices.[5][6][7] Imran Khan, chairman of the PTI, proceeded
          to form a coalition government, announcing his cabinet shortly after the elections.[8] The newly formed
          coalition government included members of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement and Pakistan Muslim League (Q).[9]

          Regarding the voting process, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) outrightly rejected reports of rigging
          and stated that the elections had been fair and free.[10][11][12] A top electoral watchdog, Free and Fair
          Election Network (FAFEN), also said that the 2018 general elections in Pakistan had been "more transparent in
          some aspects" than the previous polls.[13] In its preliminary report, the European Union Election Observation
          Mission said that no rigging had been observed during the election day in general, but found a "lack of
          equality" and criticized the process more than it had in the Pakistani election of 2013.[14][15]
        </p>
        <p>
          This was also the third consecutive election from Pakistan's most recent transition to democracy where a
          democratic handover of power was observed.[16] The day after the election, despite reservations over the
          result, PML(N) conceded defeat.[17] Pakistan's election commission reiterated its position, rejecting reports
          of rigging.[18] The voter turnout dropped from 55.0% in 2013 to 51.7%.[19]

          Although the election commission rejected rigging allegations,[20] there were claims that Khan was able to
          lure more electable candidates to his party than PML(N), which led to suggestions that there was electoral
          inequality.[21] However, the newly minted opposition decided against boycotting parliament, lending legitimacy
          to the electoral process by parliamentary participation.[22][23][24] Initially a recount was ordered in 14
          constituencies because of procedural errors.[25] Moreover, procedural errors then led to a recount on 70
          constituencies by the election commission (more than the winners margin of victory in Punjab and Federal
          elections).[26] After the conclusion of these recounts, the ECP published a seat tally which confirmed PTI's
          position of being the largest party in the National Assembly.[27] The margin for the Punjab election was
          narrow between Khan's PTI and Pakistan Muslim League (N), but independents and Pakistan Muslim League (Q)
          factions endorsed federal winners PTI, which led to Khan's party forming government in Punjab also.[28] Thus
          PML(N) lost the elections both at the provincial and the federal level,[29] becoming the opposition,
          nominating Shehbaz Sharif to be leader of the opposition at the federal level[30] and his son Hamza Shahbaz as
          opposition leader in Punjab.[31]</p>

        <h6>PRIME Minister Imran Khan delivered an emphatic address to the United Nations General Assembly on Sept 27
          that made the world sit up and think.</h6>

        <p>The focus of his speech was on Islamophobia and the occupation of Kashmir. and he spoke with such conviction
          that the audience applauded him a number of times during his speech. All the talk about radical Islam in the
          Western world was brilliantly shot down by PM Imran, saying that there was only one true Islam.

          The Pakistani prime minister systematically exposed the Indian mindset on Kashmir.

          He told the world Narendra Modi is a lifetime member of the fascist RSS, an extremist Hindu organisation that
          was behind the murder of Mahatma Gandhi in 1948. It was this ideology that drove Narendra Modi to massacre
          around 2,000 Muslims in Gujarat in 2002. Now it is the same ideology that is behind the Indian governments
          lockdown in Kashmir.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6 mt-5">
        <p>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Imran Khan, the former international cricket star turned politician who oversaw a new
          era of Pakistan’s foreign policy that distanced the country from the United States, was removed as prime
          minister early on Sunday after losing a no-confidence vote in Parliament.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vote, coming amid soaring inflation and a rift between Mr. Khan’s government and the military, capped a
          political crisis that has embroiled the country for weeks and came down to the wire in a parliamentary session
          that dragged into the early morning hours. Pakistan remains in a state of turmoil as it heads into an early
          election season in the coming months.</p>
        <p>
          Pakistan, a nuclear-armed nation with the world’s second-largest Muslim population, has struggled with
          instability and military coups since its founding 75 years ago. While no prime minister in Pakistan has ever
          completed a full five-year term in office, Mr. Khan is the first to be removed in a no-confidence vote.

          The motion to oust Mr. Khan was passed with 174 votes, two more than the requisite simple majority.</p>

        <h5>On 9 May 2023, former Pakistani Prime Minister and politician <span style="background-color: red ;"> Imran
            Khan was arrested from inside the High Court in Islamabad </span> by National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on
          the charges of corruption in connection with the Al-Qadir Trust, which he owns alongside his wife, Bushra
          Bibi.[1][2]</h5>
        <p>The arrest came a day after the military through its media wing ISPR had responded negatively to Khan's
          accusations of a high-ranking ISI official being implicated in an assassination attempt on his life the
          previous year.[3] ISPR declared Khan's arrest to be legal;[4] however, the following day, the Supreme Court of
          Pakistan deemed the arrest unlawful and mandated Khan's immediate release.[5]
        </p>
        <p> The next day on 12 May, Islamabad High Court granted two weeks bail to Khan. Shortly upon his release, Khan
          directly accused the army chief Asim Munir of playing a role in his arrest.[6]

          Attempts to arrest Khan led to protests by his supporters throughout the country.[7][8]</p>
